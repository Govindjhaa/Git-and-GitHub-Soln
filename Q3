Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code. Its workflow involves three main areas: the working directory, the staging area, and the repository.

1. Working Directory
This is where you actively edit and create files.

Files in this area are your current project files.

Any new, modified, or deleted files will show up as changes in the working directory.

Example: You edit a file called main.py — this change is in the working directory.

2. Staging Area (Index)
The staging area is where you prepare changes before committing them.

You add files to the staging area using git add.

Only staged changes will be included in the next commit.

Example: You run git add main.py — now the changes are staged and ready to be committed.

3. Repository (Local Repository)
This is the Git database where commits are stored.

When you commit, Git takes a snapshot of the staged changes and saves it in the repository.

You use git commit to move changes from the staging area to the repository.

Example: You run git commit -m "Update main.py" — now the changes are saved in your local repo.

Typical Git Workflow Steps:
Edit Files in the working directory.

Stage Changes using git add.

Commit Changes to the repository using git commit.
